Encrypt passwords as *.gpg files:

$ gpg  --quick-generate-key <user-id>
$ gpg --encrypt -o <filename>.gpg -r <user-id> -

This reads password from stdin. I used joesingo@gmail.com for the user-id since
this is easy to remember, but this does *not* need to match the email address
to which the password relates.

Note also that for Gmail one needs to use an "app password": go to the Google
security dashboard thing and create one from there.
