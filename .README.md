This repo contains config files, scripts and various bits and pieces that I
personally use.

Basic set up is:

- Clone this repo
- Move everything into `$HOME`

## Per-application instructions and notes

### Sudoers

Add the following via `visudo` (use `EDITOR=/usr/bin/nvim sudo -E visudo` if it
otherwise insists on using nano...)

```
joe ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/joe/bin/echo-tty
joe ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/rfkill
```

### (Neo)vim

```
$ ~/.vim/bundle/vim-setup/setup.sh
```

### Openbox

* If wanting to run Openbox standalone (i.e. just using `openbox-session`
  without any other session manager), create a symlink to
  `~/.config/autostart/autostart.sh` at `~/.config/openbox/autostart`

### Xfce

* Extra stuff to install (if not coming from an initial Xubuntu install but
  doing `apt-get instal xfce4`)
    * `xfce4-volumed` for volume keys
    * `xfce4-power-manager` for brightness keys

* To change window manager and stop `xfce4-panel`, `xfdesktop` etc, the
  settings for `xfce4-session` need to be changed. The settings can be viewed
  (and in principle edited) with `xfce4-settings-editor`; in any case the
  relevant XML file to change window manager to Openbox and panel to tint2 are
  checked into this repo.

* If it seems like the above is not working, try clearing saved sessions and
  make sure the session is not being saved on logout. For the former, launch
  `xfce4-settings-manager` and go to `Session and Startup/Session/Clear saved
  sessions`.

* I had strange issues with `gdm3` not starting the Xfce session properly, and
  I am not sure what the problem was. Switching to `lightdm` solves the
  problem.

### Unity greeter for LightDM

* Seems to be a bit of a pain to configure... To see the available
  configuration options, see `/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/com.canonical.unity-greeter.gschema.xml`

* Create
  `/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/10_unity_greeter_settings.gschema.override` to
  override the default settings (the specific filename is not important). E.g:

```
[com.canonical.unity-greeter]
draw-user-backgrounds=false
background='/home/joe/pictures/wallpapers/winxp.jpg'
play-ready-sound=false
draw-grid=false
```

* Then run `glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/` as root to apply
  changes.

### Remapping caps lock to escape

* Create a config file at `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-joe-keyboard.conf`:

```
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "keyboard defaults"
    MatchIsKeyboard "on"
    Option "XKbOptions" "caps:escape"
EndSection
```
