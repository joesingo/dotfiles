# dotfiles

This repo contains config files, scripts and various bits and pieces that I
personally use.

I usually check this repo out in `$HOME` directly.

## Packages

Core packages to install on a new setup:

```
sudo apt install git make unzip fzf openbox
```

Packages which can be installed later as required:

sudo apt install tint2 redshift feh xclip maim alsa-utils playerctl dunst galculator
```
```

Things to install manually (and avoid Ubuntu repos):

- tmux (build from source)
- kitty (binaries available; create symlink in `~/bin`)
- nvim (binaries available; create symlink in `~/bin`)
- Google chrome (`.deb` available)

## Per-application instructions and notes

### dmenu

I have my own fork which simply applies a few nice patches:

```
git clone gh:joesingo/dmenu
git checkout 4.7-lineheight-fuzzy
sudo apt install libx11-dev libxinerama-dev libxft-dev
make && sudo make install
```

### Terminal setup

Install kitty and tmux as described above.

The kitty config uses the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font
for nice ligatures. To install, download and extract the Zip from the releases
on GitHub, e.g.:

```
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts/firacode
unzip Fira_Code_v6.2.zip -d ~/.local/share/fonts/firacode/
```

I also like [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) for Openbox and
dunst fonts. The install procedure is identical.

### neovim

First install [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim#quickstart):

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

My vim configuration is a bit of a mess between `.vimrc` and `init.vim`. May
need to comment out a bunch of stuff in `init.vim` after loading `packer` so
that we can run `:PackerCompile` and `:PackerInstall` for the first time. Then
various plugins and colour schemes should be in place to restore the configs.

### Sudoers

Add the following via `visudo` (use `EDITOR=/usr/bin/nvim sudo -E visudo` if it
otherwise insists on using nano...)

```
joe ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/joe/bin/echo-tty
```

### Remapping caps lock to escape

* Create a config file at `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-joe-keyboard.conf`:

```
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "keyboard defaults"
    MatchIsKeyboard "on"
    Option "XKbOptions" "caps:escape"
EndSection
```
